# MIDIAdapter
Softare made to sit inbetween OBS and a MIDI device for automation.

## Tested Devices
- Novation
  - Launchpad MK2

Technically it can work with any MIDI device but we cannot ensure that it will work, if anything goes wrong the developers are not at fault since (we assume) you are using a unsupported/untested device.
